## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a web app for a user to explore UFO sighting data. Within this web app, a user can search using multiple criteria in order to filter out specific data. The user is able to filter results by date, city, state, country, and shape.

web app can be accessed here: https://rbinghamjr.github.io/UFOs/

## Results

This is an exciting web app that provides the user multiple possibilities and functionality for quick search on UFO data as can be seen here:

In the above image, the default results are shown and no user input has been provided. The next few images will show result set when filtering on specific user entries. One advantage of this functionality is the data is reset when applying filters and you can return to the original default data at any time by removing filters.

In the above image, the user provided input to the date field and the results show the filtered data for that date. In the next image we can add multiple filters like date and state to find a more localized location in the data.

## Summary

Although the web app works well and performs as designed there are some drawbacks to its functionality. One drawback is clearing the filter data. In its current state, the user must manually clear the filter data in order to "reset" to the deafult state. Adding a clear filters option would be on way to enhance the web app. Another drawback and potential enhancement is the need for the user to know the data before entering it in the filter. One way to correct this would be to have drop down functionality instead of user input. The dro down box could hold all the values that can be filtered which would make the user experience more precise and less difficult.
